              We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information

              personally identifiable information through the Application and/or
              Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor
              their children&#39s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy
              by instructing their children never to provide personally
              identifiable information through the Application and/or Services
              without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a
              child has provided personally identifiable information to us
              through the Application and/or Services, please contact us. You
              must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing
              of your personally identifiable information in your country (in
              some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on
              your behalf).
